It’s a game about two enemies learning to trust one another as they fight for survival in a near-future climate dystopia. The game won the <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/climate-jam-2022/rate/1511021\">grand jury award</a> (the top award) at the IndieCade Climate Jam.</p>\n<p>It was made in collaboration with students from USC's School of Cinematic Arts, NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, University of Waterloo, and University of Toronto. I was primarily involved in game and narrative design, as well as being one of two programmers.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://beagle-studios.itch.io/row\">play the game on itch.io</a> with a desktop computer.
