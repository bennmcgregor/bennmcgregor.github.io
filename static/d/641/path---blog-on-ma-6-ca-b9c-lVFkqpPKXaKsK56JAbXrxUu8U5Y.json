{"data":{"post":{"html":"<p> <br>\n<br>\nIn <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/212888332\">the interview</a> that the quote is from, he discusses the concept of <em>ma</em>, a central principle in Japanese aesthetics and culture. Very generally, <em>ma</em> is a concept of space and time being a unified idea or experience. However, the idea reveals itself more easily through examples and observation. Many natural phenomena are imbued with <em>ma</em>, such as clouds in the sky—they are constantly transforming and taking on new forms that are never complete. Or the blossoming of a flower, which we know will soon wilt and fade away. <em>Ma</em> is more than ephemerality, however. It also represents transformation, connection and division. Let's say you're sitting on the beach during golden hour, people are swimming, waves are crashing, and seagulls are calling out. Soon the sun sets, and you find yourself in the quiet dark, the moon reflecting on the calm water's surface. You've been transported from one place, with all its particular sights and sounds, to another place with its own distinct feeling. <em>Ma</em> is a characteristic of the setting sun, and it's in the experience of moving from one space to another, and also in the relationship between those two different spaces. Japanese gardens are designed in a sequence of stages, so as you follow a designated path from a miniature forest to stepping stones across a pond covered in lilies to a weathered temple, hidden away, your experience unfolds with each new space that you visit. You might have a similar experience as you begin to grasp the concept of <em>ma</em> reading this post, or while exploring my blog, drawing connections between the different ideas, artwork, and music featured in each post.</p>\n<p><em>Ma</em> is broad and multifaceted, taking on various meanings in different contexts. I've highlighted some examples that illustrate my point, and instead of trying to further articulate it in general terms, I've attached links to some relevant articles at the end of the post.</p>\n<p>With the idea of <em>ma</em> in mind, the meaning of Isozaki's quote becomes clearer. The silence he is referring to is full of potential, like a blank canvas about to be painted. In <a href=\"https://bennmcgregor.com/blog/embodied-light\">an earlier post</a>, I describe how music can both transport us to different places and bring us together as a result of the emotion associated with it.</p>\n<p>It's a similar idea here. Silence is simultaneously filled with every possible sound in our minds, and with none at all. It's like the moment right after a song ends on a playlist in shuffle play, before you know what the next one will be. I'm reminded of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FAFouzo3ZHQ?t=1784\">ending of Sibelius' Symphony No. 5</a>. The music builds up until the entire orchestra is playing at its loudest, but when the final cadence arrives, silence punctuates each chord. After reaching its peak, the only way the music can grow even louder and greater is with silence that encompasses a sound so grand it can only be heard in our minds.</p>\n<p>To me, the musical and artistic implications of this idea are endless and fascinating. But <em>ma</em> is much more than just music.
