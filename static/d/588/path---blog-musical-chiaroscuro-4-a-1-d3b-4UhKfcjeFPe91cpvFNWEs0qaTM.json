{"data":{"post":{"html":"<p> <br>\n<br>\nEmployed by artists such as Rembrandt and Caravaggio, the technique often gave a heightened sense of drama to their works. When taken to an extreme to enhance emotional impact, such as in <em>The Calling of St. Matthew</em> by Caravaggio above, it was called <em>tenebrismo</em>.\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis idea of contrast between light and dark can be carried into music. Of course, contrast—of harmonies, textures, dynamics—is a very common compositional technique. But when exaggerated to become the primary compositional element, it has such a strong impact. I'm sure there are many examples of this \"musical chiaroscuro\", but here are two in particular that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is a piece I'm currently working on: <em>Scarbo</em> from Maurice Ravel's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit\"><em>Gaspard de la Nuit</em></a>. Like the other two pieces in the piano suite, it's based off of a <a href=\"https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit/%C3%89dition_1920/Scarbo_(Pi%C3%A8ces_d%C3%A9tach%C3%A9es)\">poem</a> by Aloysius Bertrand. <em>Scarbo</em> depicts the \"nighttime mischief of a small fiend or goblin, making pirouettes, flitting in and out of the darkness, disappearing and suddenly reappearing, and creating a nightmarish scene for the observer lying in his bed\" (from Wikipedia). Ravel extensively uses contrast of all sorts to create an intense, unnerving, and thrilling piece of music. You'll understand when you hear it:\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n  </p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden;\">\n  <iframe style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BspU0vUB_tg?start=2050\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p> <br>\n<br>\nOn <em>Scarbo</em>, Ravel said \"I wanted to make a caricature of romanticism. Perhaps it got the better of me.\"\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother great use of contrast, taken to the extreme, is the number <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(West_Side_Story_song)\"><em>Cool</em></a> from Leonard Bernstein's musical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story\"><em>West Side Story</em></a>. Instead of fear and mischief, the song evokes barely-restrained anger and aggression through sudden accents, changes in orchestration, and shouts contrasted with near-whispers. The choreography and lighting (very clearly influenced by paintings like the Caravaggio at the top of this post!) really add to the intensity:\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n  </p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden;\">\n  <iframe style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wugWGhItaQA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;","frontmatter":{"title":"Musical Chiaroscuro","image":"blog/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg","description":"Chiaroscuro, or literally Italian for \"light-dark\", is a painting technique that uses the balance of light and shadow to suggest and enhance the volume of three-dimensional subjects.","date":"2019-07-07"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/june-28/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Today, 6:00am"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.9731481481481481,"src":"/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/8484e/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/6ad16/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 200w,\n/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/8f1ca/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 400w,\n/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/8484e/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 800w,\n/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/150f3/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/bea14/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 1600w,\n/static/a6e51e85ea7cdaad2ce55e334c76626b/4e11d/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg 2102w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"pageContext":{"post_slug":"/blog/musical-chiaroscuro/","img_path":"blog/caravaggio-st-matthew.jpg","prev_slug":null,"next_slug":"/blog/june-28/"}}
