When taken to an extreme to convey this drama and enhance emotional impact, such as in the painting by -- above, it was called <em>tenebrismo</em>.\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis idea of contrast between light and dark can be carried into music. Of course, contrast—of harmonies, textures, dynamics—is very common in music. But when exaggerated to become the primary compositional element, the results are remarkable. I'm sure there are many examples, but there are two in particular that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <em>Scarbo</em> from Maurice Ravel's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit\"><em>Gaspard de la Nuit</em></a> that I'm currently attempting to learn. Like the other two pieces in the piano suite, it's based off of a <a href=\"https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Gaspard_de_la_nuit/%C3%89dition_1920/Scarbo_(Pi%C3%A8ces_d%C3%A9tach%C3%A9es)\">poem</a> by Aloysius Bertrand depicting the \"nighttime mischief of a small fiend or goblin, making pirouettes, flitting in and out of the darkness, disappearing and suddenly reappearing, and creating a nightmarish scene for the observer lying in his bed\" (from Wikipedia). Ravel extensively uses contrast of all sorts to create an intense, unnerving, and thrilling piece of music.
