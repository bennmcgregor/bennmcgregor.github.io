However, my line of thought has evolved beyond physical spaces, since certain songs or pieces of music can also remind us of particular memories, moments, or people in our lives. What's remarkable is that the same music can mean different things to different people. For example, the piece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH2PH0auTUU\"><em>Rhapsody in Blue</em></a> might remind one person of how their grandmother used to play it on the piano at home. At the same time, a child who grew up watching Disney's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJ-kGuOA_Q\"><em>Fantasia 2000</em></a> (or Woody Allen's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2akLhosPEg\"><em>Manhattan</em></a>) might think of bustling New York City.</p>\n<p>It seems like music has this capacity to bring us together, across our differences. I'm going to keep writing about this idea and sharing some of the related literature that I've come across, in the hopes of working towards a real product that draws on this thinking.\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Embodied Light","image":"blog/Oculus.jpg","description":"How can music transport us into new spaces?
