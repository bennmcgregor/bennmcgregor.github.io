It's far more than a collection of software—in fact, the software is only the means by which we can form new kinds of human connections, and by extension, human societies both on the internet and off of it.</p>\n<p>As a software engineering student, I'm really learning how to be an architect of a new civic society. As an architect, it's my role to understand how to facilitate these human connections to build a more connected, peaceful, ?? future.</p>\n<p> <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Web as a City","image":"blog/ma/ma.jpg","description":"I've been thinking about this quote from the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki: \"Extravagance is, for me, complete silence.\"","date":"2019-05-02"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/on-ma/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On 'Ma'"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":3.022670025188917,"src":"/static/297645c1760e2a6806d79ec6b8f6db62/8484e/ma.jpg","srcSet":"/static/297645c1760e2a6806d79ec6b8f6db62/6ad16/ma.jpg 200w,\n/static/297645c1760e2a6806d79ec6b8f6db62/8f1ca/ma.jpg 400w,\n/static/297645c1760e2a6806d79ec6b8f6db62/8484e/ma.jpg 800w,\n/static/297645c1760e2a6806d79ec6b8f6db62/150f3/ma.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"pageContext":{"post_slug":"/blog/the-web-as-a-city/","img_path":"blog/ma/ma.jpg","prev_slug":null,"next_slug":"/blog/on-ma/"}}
