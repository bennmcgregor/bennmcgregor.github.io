{"data":{"post":{"html":"<p> <br>\n<br>\nIn <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/212888332\">the interview</a> that the quote is from, he discusses the concept of <em>ma</em>, a central principle in Japanese aesthetics and culture. Very generally, you can say that <em>ma</em> is the concept of space and time being a unified idea or experience. But that description is quite opaque without a few examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ma as energy/potential (waves in ocean)</li>\n<li>ma as transformation</li>\n<li>ma as liminality (like a flower blossoming, or fleetingness of sunset, or clouds changing in the sky)</li>\n<li>ma as connection and division</li>\n<li>experiencing a space one room at a time\nThe fact is that <em>ma</em> is broad and multifaceted, taking on various meanings in different contexts. I've highlighted some examples that illustrate my point, and instead of trying to further articulate it in general terms, I've attached links to some relevant articles at the end of the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the idea of <em>ma</em> in mind, Isozaki's quote makes more sense. The silence he is referring to is full of potential, like a blank canvas waiting to be painted. In <a href=\"https://bennmcgregor.com/blog/embodied-light\">an earlier post</a>, I describe how music can both transport us to different places and bring us together as a result of the emotion associated with it.</p>\n<p>It's a similar idea here. Silence is simultaneously filled with every possible sound in our minds, and with none at all. It's like the moment right after a song ends on a playlist in shuffle play, before you know what the next one will be. I'm reminded of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FAFouzo3ZHQ?t=1784\">ending of Sibelius' Symphony No. 5</a> (the video is ridiculous, but it's an excellent recording). The music builds up until the entire orchestra is playing at its loudest, but when the final cadence arrives, silence punctuates each chord. After reaching its peak, the only way the music can grow even louder and greater is with silence that encompasses a sound so grand it can only be heard in our minds.</p>\n<p>By \"silence,\" however, Isozaki means <em>ma</em>.</p>\n<p>Or how, after saving the world, Superman <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gbVg3vGsDx0?t=104\">flies off into the sunrise</a> towards new, unknown adventures.</p>\n<p>Follow these links (in order of ascending difficulty) to learn more about <em>ma</em>:</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://ricepapermagazine.ca/2013/02/%E9%96%93-an-aesthetic-of-space-time/\">Ricepaper Magazine Article</a> that describes the concept in fairly straightforward terms. <br>\nA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/25/archives/architecture-view-on-the-japanese-esthetic.html\">New York Times Review of an exhibit on <em>ma</em></a> curated by Isozaki.
